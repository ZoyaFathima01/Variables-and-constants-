One of the main challenges I faced during this lab was fully understanding how memory sections in Assembly work. I had to take a moment to really think through the difference between the .data and .bss sections and where each variable should go. Another issue I ran into was just remembering the syntax for moving values into registers and storing them back into memory — it’s easy to mix up square brackets or forget to dereference. Even after writing the code, there was a bit of anxiety around whether the result would store properly since there’s no visible output. I had to carefully step through the program in GDB using ni, and even then, figuring out the right command to check the result (x/d &result) took a minute. Overall, the debugging process was helpful but slow at first, especially without symbols. But once I saw 25 as the result, it felt like everything clicked.
